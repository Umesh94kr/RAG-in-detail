    "#### **Re-ranking methods in RAG**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Overview** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Reranking is a crucial step in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that aims to improve the relevance and quality of retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It involves reassessing and reordering initially retrieved documents to ensure that the most pertinent information is prioritized for subsequent processing or presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Motivation** \n",
    "\n",
    "- The primary motivation for reranking in RAG systems is to overcome limitations of initial retrieval methods, which often rely on simpler similarity metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reranking allows for more sophisticated relevance assessment, taking into account nuanced relationships between queries and documents that might be missed by traditional retrieval techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This process aims to enhance the overall performance of RAG systems by ensuring that the most relevant information is used in the generation phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Components** \n",
    "\n",
    "Reranking systems typically include the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Initial Retriever : Often a vector store using embedding-based similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Reranking Model : \n",
    "    - A Large Language Model (LLM) for scoring relevance\n",
    "    - A Cross-Encoder model specifically trained for relevance assessment \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Scoring Mechanism: A method to assign relevance scores to documents\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Sorting and Selection Logic: To reorder documents based on new scores\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Benefits of this Approach** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Improved Relevance: By using more sophisticated models, reranking can capture subtle relevance factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility: Different reranking methods can be applied based on specific needs and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhanced Context Quality: Providing more relevant documents to the RAG system improves the quality of generated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduced Noise: Reranking helps filter out less relevant information, focusing on the most pertinent content."
