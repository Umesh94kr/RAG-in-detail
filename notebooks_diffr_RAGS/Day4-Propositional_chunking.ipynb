    "\n",
    "Proposition chunking = splitting text into tiny factual statements instead of random fixed-size blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously chunks are formed on the basis of number of characters in chunk and overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can split a sentence randomly from mid or etc.. (overlap is useful)\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we can make each chunk factual and self-contained propositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Benefits of Propositional Chunking**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Granularity** : By breaking the document into small factual propositions, the system allows for highly specific retrieval, making it easier to extract precise answers from large or complex documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quality Assurance** : The use of a quality-checking LLM ensures that the generated propositions meet specific standards, improving the reliability of the retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility in Retrieval** : The comparison between proposition-based and larger chunk-based retrieval allows for evaluating the trade-offs between granularity and broader context in search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **WorkFlow**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load document\n",
    "- Apply Chunking \n",
    "- Use propositional Chunking (using LLM)\n",
    "- Create VectorDB\n",
    "- Pass the query and retrieved context to LLM\n",
    "- Evaluate the responses for `propositional chunking` and `Normal Chunking`"

    "Conventional Wisdom vs. Founder Mode\n",
    "The essay argues that the traditional advice given to growing companies—hiring good people and giving them autonomy—often fails when applied to startups.\n",
    "This approach, suitable for established companies, can be detrimental to startups where the founder's vision and direct involvement are crucial. \"Founder Mode\" is presented as an emerging paradigm that is not yet fully understood or documented, contrasting with the conventional \"manager mode\" often advised by business schools and professional managers.\n",

    "Founders possess unique insights and abilities that professional managers do not, primarily because they have a deep understanding of their company's vision and culture.\n",
    "Graham suggests that founders should leverage these strengths rather than conform to traditional managerial practices. \"Founder Mode\" is an emerging paradigm that is not yet fully understood or documented, with Graham hoping that over time, it will become as well-understood as the traditional manager mode, allowing founders to maintain their unique approach even as their companies scale.\n",
    "Challenges of Scaling Startups\n",

    ". This unconventional method allowed Jobs to maintain a startup-like environment even as Apple grew, fostering innovation and direct communication across hierarchical levels.
