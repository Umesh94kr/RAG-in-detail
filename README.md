# RAG-in-detail

This repository is a hands-on exploration of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems, starting from basic implementations and gradually moving toward more advanced and production-relevant techniques.

The goal of this repo is to understand RAG **as a system**, not just as a vector search + LLM wrapper.

## What this repository covers

- Basic end-to-end RAG pipelines  
- RAG over structured data (CSV, documents)
- Chunking strategies  
  - Fixed-size chunking  
  - Semantic chunking  
  - Propositional and contextual chunking  
- Query understanding and transformation  
  - Query rewriting  
  - Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)  
- Retrieval improvements  
  - Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + vector search)  
  - Fusion retrieval  
  - Reranking  
  - Contextual compression  
- Advanced RAG techniques  
  - Graph RAG  
  - CRAG (Corrective / Confidence-aware RAG)

Each concept is explored through **Jupyter notebooks** with experiments and observations.
